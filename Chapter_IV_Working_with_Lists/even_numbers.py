# We can use the range() function to tell Python to skip numbers in a given range. If you pass a third argument to range(), Python uses the value as a step size when generating numbers.
even_numbers = list(range(2,11,2))
print(even_numbers)
# In this example, the range() function starts with the value 2, and then adds 2 to that value. It adds 2 repeatedly until it reaches or passes the end value, 11, and produces the result:
# [2,4,6,8,10]
